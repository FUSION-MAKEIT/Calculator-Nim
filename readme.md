This is a very interesting code language though I bet no one has ever seen it, theirs also Q which you probably also never heard of, though I hope you have a marry day.

To run this simply download Nim, then once you have done that, make a new Nim file, name it calculator or whatever, then after that run the command 'nimble c -r calculator.nim'
I hope you enjoy this beautiful "never even heard of" code language.
